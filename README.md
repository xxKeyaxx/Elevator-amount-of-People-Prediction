# Elevator-amount-of-People-Prediction
This is an ongoing group project of mine to create an efficient system of elevators in busy buildings in order to make elevators more efficient

Steps:
1. Install packages by running these commands on your terminal
    pip install ultralytics
    pip install supervision
    pip install streamlit
2. Run this command to run the app
   streamlit run Elevator_People_Prediciton.py
3. Upload an image containing a person to the app and watch it do it's work :)
